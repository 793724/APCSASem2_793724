    <p>
    	For nearly 4,000 years, the Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest man-made structure in the world as well as the first, and largest, of the three pyramids at Giza. It was constructed for the Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu between 2584 and 2561 BCE and is the only one of the seven wonders that remains intact today.

    <p>
    	The Colossus of Rhodes, constructed between 292 and 280 BCE, was a 110-foot bronze statue of the sun god Helios. Unfortunately, in 226 BCE, the statue was destroyed by an earthquake; over 800 years later, the remaining ruins were sold to a merchant and melted down. New York's Statue of Liberty is said to be modeled after the Colossus.

    	Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon between 605 and 562 BCE as a gift for his wife, Amtis of Media. The gardens were said to consist of walls of flora and fauna over 75 feet tall, but they were reportedly destroyed in an earthquake around 100 CE.

    <p>
    	At nearly 440 feet tall, the Lighthouse of Alexandria was commissioned by Ptolemy I Soter, king of Egypt and founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty, and completed around 280 BCE. According to legend, its light could be seen from 35 miles out at sea. Eventually, earthquakes in 956, 1303, and 1323 CE destroyed the structure.

    	The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was built in 351 BCE under the orders of Persian queen Artemisia, who wished for it to serve as the tomb for her husband, King Mausolus. The final structure was 135 feet tall and ornately decorated with sculptures. It was destroyed by earthquakes and eventually dismantled in 1494 CE.

    	The Greek sculptor Phidias constructed the Statue of Zeus at Olympia around 500 BCE. The 40-foot ivory and gold statue, which depicted the Greek god Zeus on his throne, was meant to awe worshippers coming to the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. Around 500 CE, the statue was taken to Constantinople and destroyed by an earthquake.
